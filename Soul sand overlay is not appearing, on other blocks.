My current situation is this; I wanted a smoother transition between soul sand, stone and obsidian, for a specific project.
However, for some reason it does not seem to work. I have tryed making a standalone pack for just these three blocks, lo and behold
it also did not work. Also I have tryed overlaying a dirt overlay, I had, onto soul sand, and that worked. So, now I am here and confused.
If anyone is able to help, I would appreciate it a lot.

My config file looks like this:

matchBlocks=stone obsidian
method=overlay
tiles=0-16
connectBlocks=soul_sand
layer=cutout

If you need anything else feel free to ask.
